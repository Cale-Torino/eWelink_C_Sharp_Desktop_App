eWelink_C_Sharp_Desktop_App

Using the eWelink API in C#. There is a DotNET lib version [here](https://github.com/narchibald/dotnet-ewelink-api) however it's not really necessary to use libs since everything can be leveraged in JSON relatively easily.

Getting data and switching devices after auth is all you need to do, the SONOFF video camera is not included in these example files.
